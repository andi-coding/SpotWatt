# Environment Variables Migration

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Migrated from deprecated `functions.config()` to `.env` approach (March 2026 deadline).

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `.env` file
Location: `firebase/functions/.env`
```bash
API_KEY=
```

### 2. Updated Code
Changed from:
```javascript
const expectedApiKey = functions.config().api?.key || process.env.API_KEY;
```

To:
```javascript
const expectedApiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

### 3. Security
- `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` (line 9)
- API key is never committed to version control
- Firebase CLI automatically loads `.env` during deployment

## Deployment

The `.env` file is automatically loaded by Firebase CLI:
```bash
cd firebase
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Output confirms:
```
✅ Loaded environment variables from .env.
```

## Notes

- The deprecation warning from Firebase CLI is just a general notice
- Our code no longer uses `functions.config()` - verified with grep
- Old config still exists in Firebase but is no longer used
- Function tested and working correctly with new `.env` approach

## Cleanup (Optional)

To remove old runtime config (not necessary, but clean):
```bash
# This will fail after March 2026 anyway
firebase functions:config:unset api
```
